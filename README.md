# Gospel Audio Messages

This repository contains a simple web application for sharing and listening to gospel audio messages with a toggleable light/dark theme and downloadable audio files.


## Features

- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes with one click.
- **Audio Playback:** Play messages directly in your browser.
- **Downloadable Files:** Download audio files easily.
- **Custom Styling:** Adjust colors with CSS variables.


## Installation

- Download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it, then open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Or copy the code directly into your site.
- No extra dependencies needed—Bootstrap is via CDN.

   - Load `index.html` in your browser.
2. **Interact:**
   - Toggle themes with the top-right button.
   - Play or download audio messages.

## Code Explanation
